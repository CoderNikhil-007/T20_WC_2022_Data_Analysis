Python Code
The data_extraction.py script is responsible for scraping data from ESPN Cricinfo in the form of JSON files. This script utilizes [insert library names] to perform the data extraction. The extracted data is then cleaned using another Python script, Data_Analysis.py, ensuring that the dataset is ready for further analysis.


Data Transformation
The cleaned data is then transformed using Power Query in Power BI. The data_transformation.pbix file contains the Power BI project with the necessary transformations and measures applied to the dataset. This step is crucial for preparing the data for analysis and visualization.

Analysis Measures
